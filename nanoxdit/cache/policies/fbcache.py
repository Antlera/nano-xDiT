# First-Block-Cache policy (ParaAttention / xDiT style), for Wan.
#
# Signal: the unit's first-block residual (block0_out - input). The mechanism runs
# the first block for us (needs_first_block_probe) and fills ctx.first_block_residual;
# we skip the rest of the unit when that residual is close to the last computed
# step's. The reference is refreshed only on COMPUTE steps (canonical FBCache).
#
# Note: this signal is inherently whole-unit — it predicts "the rest of the unit
# from its first block". It is meaningful at "stack" granularity; at "per_block"
# granularity a unit is a single block, so the probe is the whole computation and
# nothing can be skipped. Use TeaCache (or a custom signal) for per-block research.
